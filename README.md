# Laptop-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction
This project explores laptop sales data in Excel, including data cleaning, visualizations, statistical analysis, and regression modeling, aiming to uncover the factors influencing laptop prices based on specifications.
# Laptop Sales Data Analysis in Excel

## Overview

This project explores the relationships between various laptop specifications and their prices using data analysis and regression modeling in Microsoft Excel. By examining factors such as screen size, CPU speed, RAM, and GPU type, the goal is to uncover insights into how these attributes influence laptop pricing. The project also includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset). It contains information about laptop specifications and prices.

## Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

1. Removed duplicate rows.
2. Fixed column headers for consistency.
3. Converted data types (e.g., decimal format).
4. Cleaned text data (e.g., split "ScreenResolution" column).
5. Removed special characters.
6. Checked for missing data and handled it.
7. Ensured consistent formatting.
8. Checked for outliers and took appropriate actions.
9. Applied data validation rules.
10. Saved the cleaned data.

## Data Analysis with Visualization

Several questions were answered using data analysis and visualizations, including:

1. Average screen size (in inches) of the laptops.
2. Company with the highest average laptop price.
3. Most common operating system (OpSys).
4. Laptop with the highest amount of RAM (in GB).
5. Range of laptop prices in the dataset.

Visualizations were created to illustrate the answers to these questions.

## Statistical Analysis

A linear regression analysis was performed using Excel, and the provided output was interpreted. The analysis included regression statistics, ANOVA, and coefficients. The relationship between the predictor variable (X Variable RAM) and the target variable (Price) was examined.

## Conclusion

Based on the regression analysis, it was concluded that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between X Variable RAM and the Price of the laptops. For every one-unit increase in X Variable RAM, Price is estimated to increase by approximately 4,600.09, and the model explains about 47% of the variance in Price.
